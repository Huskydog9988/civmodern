# CivModern

## Features

CivModern features radar, a macro to hold left (bound to `-`) or right click (bound to `=`), a macro for auto attacking (bound to `0`), and a macro for travelling down ice roads (bound to backspace).
It highlights compacted items, making them easier to spot at a glance.
These features can be configured in game by pressing R.
The controls can also be modified in your controls screen.
